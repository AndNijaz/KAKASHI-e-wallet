# Kakashi E-Wallet

This project is used for my final high school exam. This project is web service for sending or recieving money. It should do same job as paypal does although it is on much lower level, it is just school project after all. 

## Technologies 
Technoloies used in this project are: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, NODE.js for creating REST API (different repository), Parcel
This project is live on Netlify domain

## How it works?
Firstly, you have to register account. Soon after, you will have form for inputing credit cart. !!! Use fake credit card data !!!. Then you log in. By default you have 10000 on credit card and you can deposit that on application account. From there you can send money to another account. You can create new accont and try to send money between that account. You can also transform money to credit card again. 

## Note
Before reading source code I have to note that this project is huge mess. This was my first project which uses almost all knowledge I developed until that point. I wanted to express it all and my final high school exam was perfect opportunity. Well, I highly focused on javascript so my html and css code is in terrible condition. To be honest I am shamed by it. <br>
For javascript I would say that is average junior (beginner) javascript code with some cool features. <br>
Before creating this project I didn't know anything about server session or server acces token, nor about stuff like signing in, so there isn't any kind of security. This is basically like working with normal forms, sending requests and getting responses with some "validation". <br>
Although I said everything bad on the first, I have to say that I am proud on this project hence it was my first big project. There are some signs of "clean" javascript code and some kind of logic is developed. Design in this project is also good.

REST API is different repository

Good luck with checking source code.

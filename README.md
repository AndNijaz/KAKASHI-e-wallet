# Kakashi E-Wallet

This project holds significant weight as it represents the culmination of my high school experience, serving as a pivotal component of my final exam. Its purpose is to establish a web service for seamless money transactions, akin to the functionality provided by PayPal. Although it operates on a smaller scale, given its nature as a school project, it aims to replicate the core functionalities while providing a valuable learning experience.

## Technologies 
Technoloies used in this project are: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, NODE.js for creating REST API (different repository), Parcel

## How it works?
To begin, the initial step is to register an account. Following that, you will be prompted to input credit card information into a designated form. Please note that for security reasons, it is imperative to use fictitious credit card data. Once completed, you can proceed to log in to the application. By default, your account will be credited with 10000 units. It is possible to deposit this amount into your application account. From there, you can initiate money transfers to other accounts. Additionally, you have the option to create new accounts and test the functionality of transferring funds between them. Furthermore, there is the capability to convert funds back to the credit card format if desired

## Note
Prior to exploring the source code, it is essential to acknowledge that this project may appear disorganized and intricate. As my first project encompassing a vast array of knowledge I had acquired thus far, it served as an ideal platform to showcase my comprehensive understanding. I aimed to incorporate all facets and leverage the opportunity presented by my final high school exam. However, it is important to recognize that my emphasis was primarily on JavaScript, which resulted in the HTML and CSS code being in a less polished condition. <br>
Before creating this project I didn't know anything about server session or server acces token, nor about stuff like signing in, so there isn't any kind of security. This is basically like working with normal forms, sending requests and getting responses with some "validation". <br>
Despite my previous critique, it is important to emphasize that I take great pride in this project, considering it as my first significant undertaking. While I may have expressed some negative aspects earlier, it doesn't diminish the sense of accomplishment and satisfaction I derived from completing this project.
